        description : "A lark is likely to have a sunnier disposition than a night owl. Older research had suggested a link between happiness and young morning-type people, but Renee Biss, a graduate student at the University of Toronto and Rottman Research Institute, and her colleagues set out to add older folks to the equation. \"We found that morningness in both younger and older people was associated with greater experience of positive emotions,\‚Äù she tells HuffPost. Morning birds also reported higher ratings of how healthy they felt, she said."

        description : "In a 2008 study of college students at a Texas University, the students who identifed as morning-type people had GPAs that were a full point higher than those of their evening-type peers, WebMD reported. The uptick in test scores is likely due to the behavioral patterns of morning people: They're driven to go to sleep earlier, skipping out on any number of potentially-distracting nighttime activities to be found on a college campus, and they're also driven to wake up earlier, possibly making it easier to show up on time for class or squeeze in more studying, researcher Daniel J. Taylor, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at the University of North Texas, told WebMD."

        description:"They don't need to! \"A morning person usually awakens very quickly with very little fogginess,\" says Brown, \"ready for a high level of activity very quickly.\" Morning types show \"a lot of energy and joy in the morning,\" says Smolensky."

        description:"Before a night owl has shrugged off the morning fog, an early bird may have gone for a jog, cooked breakfast and sent a dozen emails. Especially when it comes to anything that's more \"cognitively challenging,\" larks like to plan activities earlier in the day, says Biss."

        title:"They're more conscientious.",
        description:"On the personality spectrum, more conscientious people are also more efficient, organized and goal-oriented, and they also typically pay more attention to details. In some research, morning-type people have been linked to conscientiousness, says Brown. They may even be \"more alert, almost anxious in a positive way,\" he says. Conscientiousness may also account for some reports of morning people who plan ahead and act more proactively when faced with a brewing problem."

        \
        But it's unclear if that's because of something inherent to being a night owl or because of society's imposed demands. \"Morning people are the people who have set the rules for society -- when you get up, when things are organized, when things are closed down,\" says Brown. \"The evening people have not had that choice as much,\" he says, and are often walking through life chronically sleep-deprived. That alone is enough to put physical and mental health at risk."

        description:"In a small 2013 study, larks were less likely than night owls to possess \"Dark Triad\" personality characteristics like narcissism, Machiavellianism (meaning a person may be manipulative) and psychopathy, potentially because the darkness of night allows evening-type people to get away with dark deeds."
